Strongly-typed c# primitives to avoid primitive obsession

## What is Primitive Obsession

Primitive obsession is a code smell where primitive data types are used excessively to represent your data models. This is a common problem that can lead to poorly written code and several failures.

For example, a string could represent a name, an address, price or temperature. This can make it difficult to understand what the code is doing and can lead to bugs.

To fix this problem, you can use strongly-typed objects instead of primitive data types. This will make your code more readable and maintainable
